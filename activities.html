                                We at Children Toy Foundation are working for the Right of the Child to Play since 1982. 
                                In 28 municipal schools of Mumbai about 5-6 thousand Children benefit through our projects. 
                                Besides 4 schools in Baroda and 20 village schools at the outskirts of Allahabad also benefit. 
                                We entertain children in Hospitals also and at times we benefit construction sites children also. 
                                For our concept of Olympics of Mind games we have won an international award also.

                                We are holding Interschool, Intercollege and Families On The Spot Mind Games Contest for the year 2016. 
                                The contestants will be taught the games on the spot. 
                                They have to exhibit on the spot grasping power and analyzing and planning capacity. 
                                The games are like Chinese Checkers, Reversei, I drop, 5 in a row and many other memory games. 
                                We are sure you will encourage us by participating so that slowly we can develop into a bigger event.

                                Children love nothing better than doing something on their own. 
                                There is nothing more fulfilling than moving forwards at one’s own initiative an drive. 
                                On the spot Games Contest is aimed at testing the skill, grasping power, instant judging and planning capacity of the young participants. 
                                The Contest, a distinguishing feature of the CHILDREN TOY FOUNDATION, has caught the imagination of people, both children and adults alike.

                                While setting up a toy / game library entails a fairly substantial investment, 
                                play centres which let childred play, but not carry home a toy or game, 
                                are immentsely suitable in the case of civic schools which suffer from chronic funds crunch. 
                                So the FOUNDATION intends carrying out a campaign which would convince the Government to set up at least a play centre if not a library in every municipal school all over the country.

                                Anybody can set up a library, provided the basic conviction is there. Following is the game plan for a modest library, to suit the Indian conditions :<br>
                                Area: 200/250 sq.ft. If a hall and ground are attached it would be most ideal since that would facilitate holding of competitions and similar other events.<br>
                                Investment:<br>
                                Toys Rs. 20,000<br>
                                Games Rs. 20,000<br>

                                The Foundation helps those aspiring to set up a toy/ game library by guiding them from the moment of conception to the moment of delivery . 
                                To begin with, it advises on what to buy and where to buy and why to buy. 
                                It acts as a go between the manufacturer and buyer of toys / games, ensuring the best bargain value for money. 
                                Then it provides the necessary training to a core group of volunteers on how to run the library in a professional fashion. 
                                Wherever possible , it helps out in repairing and replacing damaged toys and raising funds from individual philanthropists, charitable trusts, social welfare organizations, etc, so that the library is on a sound footing.

                                Earlier in 1996-97 CTF used to arrange play sessions in evening for street children around its office at Fort. Everyday around 30-40 children from the surrounding used to play.
                                Prompted by this overwhelming response and in its quest to reach out to more children at distant places, an idea of developing a mobile service just occurred and today it’s a big thing.
                                The van was named as LAFF van (Let’s All have Fun & Frolic). 
                                LAFF van has helped to propagate the toy library project in Northern states of India all the way up to Jammu and Kashmir.

                        CHILDREN TOY FOUNDATION has been lucky enough to have  got favourable reactions from industry and business circles; but not as much as was expected of them. 
                        All the same, resource crunch is one of the major factors that has come in the way of any major expansion of the FOUNDATION’S activities.
                        To overcome that, the FOUNDATION has thought of creating a corpus fund of Rs. 7 crore through donations and grants. 
                        Even the annual interest from that amount will be sufficient to make several of the FOUNDATION’S dreams come true. 
                        By a rough estimate,the interest should be sufficient to supplement the budget of at least 100 new libraries every year.
                        One deserving case is the extra expenses involved in buying a wider range of toys for children with special needs. 
                        Another, the funds shortage chronic in the case of municipal schools, remand home, orphanages, old people’s homes and rehabilitation centres for women. 
                        Lf a handicapped person procures a specially equipped van which he wants to convert into a mobile library,
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        if a group of street kids want to set up a play centre, 
                        if a retired jawans want to self-employ themselves by running a library these cases can be deemed deserving of the special grant. 
                        Tax exemption will be sought from the Government on the Rs 7 Crore corpus fund in the light of the humanitarian goals. 
                        As it is, donations to the trust running the FOUNDATION are exempt from tax under Section
                        80 G of the Income Tax Act. 
                        If good response comes forth we can apply for 35C exemptions also.
                        That is just the beginning. 
                        To materialise the other projects like Khilona Place, Toy/ Game workshop and Toy/ Game Bank / Exchange , the FOUNDATION would need further infusion of funds. 
                        Being incorrible optimists that to optimists with a vision we are confident of making all these dreams come true. 
                        In a country renowned for Harischandra and Daan Shoora Karna , seeking assistance from individuals and organisations, from business and industry , from the haves to help out the have – nots cannot be deemed demanding too much.

                All have eyes but few have vision. Mr. Devendra Desai is one of them.
                Being a chess player, he has an analytical mind. 
                A man full of enthusiasm and with the gift of adaptability, he organises games which are unique every time. 
                So much variation in age, intellect, toys, time limit, space, kinds of organisers and still he is able to ignite enthusiasm, adapt and motivate them and is thus able to endear himself. 
                Like spectrum he has spread his activities in many states and territories. 
                Always in demand, he invents new games, arranges funds, space and trains volunteers. 
                A man who dreams to bring smile on every child’s face and says “ Happy Child; Nation’s Pride”. — Himmatbhai Dawawala – Prof. Train the Trainers classes and a thinker
                To supplement and enhance the impact of the movement, the FOUNDATION has drawn up some ambitions plans. These include :-
                
                A simple concept applied with unswerving dedication and love by Devendra Desai is worth recognition for its utility,
                appeal, and replicability. So many simple needs and pleasures in life remain unfulfilled just because they are so
                simple that it does not strike one to do it. - VINAY R. SOMANI-TRUSTEE- KARMAYOG.COM 
                
                I know everyone who knows about the Khel Vigyan project and feels that it is an excellent initiative.
                I always tell Mr. Desai that like PT which is Physical Training, we must have a period of CLT, 
                which is Creative and Logical Thinking. But again, the beauty of Khel Vigyan is that it’s not just 
                CLT but also PT because it involves Physical running around. - SANJAY BAPAT-MANAGING DIRECTOR-INDIAN NGOS.COM PVT. LTD

                        Curiosity is the key to learning.
                        It should be remembered that children have often been small keys to major investors. 
                        Alfred Graham Bell happened upon the idea of a telephone while toying with a kite. 
                        Benjamin Franklin was flying a kite in a thunderstorm when he made the momentous discovery : that lightning and electricity are one and the same. 
                        Marconi too picked up the first ever trans – Atlantic wireless signals while flying a kite. 
                        Then there is the age old spinning top which gave birth to the gyroscope and which in turn triggered the invention of the automatic pilot. 
                        French doctor Lennoe devised the stethoscope after he watched two boys on a see saw one boy scratching at one end, the other listening at the other end by applying his ear to it.
                        The FOUNDATION believes that none should discourage a child which loves to dissemble a toy / game as long as he/she is also keen on reassembling it. 
                        Because the eagerness to learn the hows and whys of things is the right way to true knowledge. 
                        The workshop will play a major role in satisfying this curiosity.

                        Toys and games can make a better currency. 
                        It should be recalled that the toy movement in India took off thanks to a consignment of toys/ games sent to Indian children by a philanthropic Indian based in Canada. 
                        One way to promote quality consciousness among Indian manufacturers as well as consumers is to introduce them to toys and games of international standard. 
                        Off and on the FOUNDATION has received gifts of toys from abroad, and it is high time the process was streamlined and the flow of toys/ games regularised at both ends. 
                        The FOUNDATION, therefore , intends setting up the Bank / Exchange to facilitate swapping at both national and international levels. 
                        In the common pool that will be formed, children can revel and romp around.

                        If you think running a toy/ game library is child’s play. 
                        You are sorely mistaken. 
                        The expertise needs to be acquired through dedication and thorough training.
                        Right now a corps of volunteers has been helping out in setting up new libraries, but in the light of the expansion that is planned , a training centre of that sort is an absolute must.

                   <p>
                    Anybody can set up a library, provided the basic conviction is there. Following is the game plan for a modest library, to suit the Indian conditions: <br>  <br>
                    Area: 200/250 sq.ft. <br>
                    If a hall and ground are attached it would be most ideal since that would facilitate holding of competitions and similar other events. <br> <br>
                    Investment: <br>
                    Toys Rs. 20,000 <br>
                    Games Rs. 20,000 <br>
                    Furniture Rs. 10,000 <br>
                    Stationery & other accessories Rs. 5,000 <br>
                    Total Rs. 55,000 <br> <br>
                    PS : Electronic toys and computer games can be fitted into space if desired, provided the budget allocation goes up.
                    <br> <br>
                    Personnel: Two or Three dedicated Volunteers plus one or two skilled persons to repair damaged toys and games.

                   </p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Venues: Schools, Hospitals , ( Children’s Wards ), Bal Bhavans, Orphanages, women’s rehabilitation homes, Old people’s homes, institutes for the handicapped , book libraries, Social welfare organizations, housing colonies, industrial complexes, business houses youth groups, Charitable trusts, Civic bodies. 
                        Small entrepreneurs keen on worthwhile investment, housewives eager to spend their time usefully, social workers wanting to spread around goodwill, anyone who can spare a mobile van all these can set up a library or at least a play centre. <br>
                        <br> Membership: A modest library of the type envisaged above can cater to the needs of 200 children 100 in the 3-6 age group and another 100 in the 6-12 age group. Entrance fee Rs. 10 to Rs.20,Monthly fee Rs. 10 to Rs. 50. safety deposit ( to cover damage to toys and games) Rs. 100/-.
                        <br><br> Mode of operation: Once a week , children can come and play, pick up a toy/ game of their choice and take it home for a week .
                        While breakage would entail paying the damages, those who handle with care can be given incentive awards.
                        <br><br> Advantages: for one thing , Children won’t be pestering parents for new toys/ games on a regular basis. For another , 6-8 persons can be gainfully employed , though their earnings may not be big.
                        <br><br> The beneficiaries can be disabled persons, retired persons, women in need, even children of older age group, so on.

                While setting up a toy / game library entails a fairly substantial investment, 
                play centres which let children play, but not carry home a toy or game, 
                are immensely suitable in the case of civic schools which suffer from chronic funds crunch. 
                So the FOUNDATION intends carrying out a campaign which would convince 
                the Government to set up at least a play centre if not a library in every municipal school all over the country.
